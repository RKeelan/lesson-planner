You are an expert front-end developer. Your task is to convert the provided image of a worksheet into one a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS.

Instructions:

1. Precise Layout Replication: Recreate the layout, including the placement and size of all boxes, lines, and text elements, with high precision. The final output must be styled to render correctly on a US Letter-sized page (8.5 x 11 inches).
2. Technical Guidance:
    * Never use box-shadow
	* Ensure no elements overlap and maintain appropriate spacing for readability.
3. Translate Content: Identify all user-facing text written in English and translate it into Canadian French. Do not translate the page identifier in the footer.
4. Preserve Identifier: The page number and identifier in the footer (e.g., 42 - A.1.1) must be preserved exactly. Remove all other text from the footer.
5. Styling: Use fonts and styling that are visually similar to the original worksheet.
6. Skip images: Do not try to reproduce any images or graphics from the worksheet. Replace them with an empty box.

Here is a sample portrait-orientation page layout for reference (you'll need to swap dimensions for landscape orientation):

```css
.page {
	background-color: white;
	width: 11in;
	height: 8.5in;
	margin: 20px auto;
	padding: 0.25in;
	box-sizing: border-box;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
}
```

If you need to create Name and Date fields in the header, use absolute positioning, like this:
```css
.header-field {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0.5in;
	font-size: 1.1em;
	display: flex;
	align-items: flex-end;
}

#date-field {
	left: 0.5in;
}

#name-field {
	right: 0.5in;
}

.header-line {
	display: inline-block;
	width: 2.5in;
	border-bottom: 1.5px solid black;
	margin-left: 8px;
	margin-bottom: -10px;
}
```

Here is styling you can use for the footer:
```css
.footer {
	padding-top: 1rem;
	font-size: 14px;
}
```

Please provide only the complete HTML code in a single block.

DO NOT include any code fences, either within the HTML or around it.
