You are an expert front-end developer. Your task is to convert the provided image of a worksheet into one or two self-contained HTML files with embedded CSS. Use your best judgement as to whether the image contains one worksheet or two.

Instructions:

1. Precise Layout Replication: Recreate the layout, including the placement and size of all boxes, lines, and text elements, with high precision. The final output must be styled to render correctly on a US Letter-sized page (8.5 x 11 inches).
2. Technical Guidance:
	* Use modern CSS layout models like Flexbox or CSS Grid to structure the page. This is especially important for creating side-by-side columns (like a text area next to a drawing box) to ensure they align correctly and have equal height.
	* Ensure no elements overlap and maintain appropriate spacing for readability.
3. Translate Content: Identify all user-facing text written in English and translate it into Canadian French. Do not translate the page identifier in the footer.
4. Preserve Identifier: The page number and identifier in the footer (e.g., 42 - A.1.1) must be preserved exactly. Remove all other text from the footer.
5. Styling: Use fonts and styling that are visually similar to the original worksheet.

Please provide only the complete HTML code in a single block for each worksheet identified.
